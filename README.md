# Boiled_Cucumber_In_Watir

## Description
A boilerplate project to jump start a test suite for cucumber using watir webdriver.
This is ment to be a project which you can use to start testing as fast a possible without making too many design decision for you.  For example this project is put together using a page object model but without using any specific page object gem library.

There are many folder which are in recommended locations based on the class objects for files.

## Setup

* 1) To begin running first you must have ruby and ruby devkit installed.  I recommend using ruby 2.0.0 and above.  This project has not been tested on lower than 2.0.0.
* 2) execute ``gem install bundle``
* 3) From your terminal navigate to the ci/bash or ci/batch if you are on windows.
* 4) From your terminal execure ``./all.bat`` or ``all.sh``
* 5) Results should be output to test_reports/cucumber.html
